Visual SLAM Point Cloud Dataset
===============
This is a dataset that provides the video and image sequences of five scenes containing textured primitives in the form of planes, spheres and cylinders. For each case, the dataset also has:
* Camera intrinsic parameters
* Camera distortion matrix
* Extrinsic matrix of each frame after initialization
* Point cloud generated on each keyframe

The results were obtained using STAM, a visual SLAM system developed at Kyushu University.
